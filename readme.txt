1) Prerequisites for Deployment:

Ensure that MATLAB runtime version 8.5 (R2015a) is installed.
If the MATLAB runtime is not installed, follow these steps:
(a) Type "mcrinstaller" at the MATLAB prompt to locate the MATLAB runtime installer.
(b) Run the MATLAB runtime installer.
Alternatively, download the Windows 64-bit version of the MATLAB runtime for R2015a from the MathWorks website.


2) Files to Deploy and Package:
Files needed for Standalone deployment:

"tumor_detection.ctf" (component technology file)
"tumor_detection.exe"
"MCRInstaller.exe"
Include this if users cannot download the MATLAB runtime; you can do this by selecting the "Runtime downloaded from web" option in the Deployment Tool.
This readme file.


3)Definitions:
For explanations of deployment terminology, refer to the MathWorks Documentation Center under MATLAB Compiler > Getting Started > About Application Deployment > Application Deployment Terms.
